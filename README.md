## Frontend Architecture:

1. React.js: The frontend is built using React.js, for a dynamic and interactive user experience.
2. State Management: React's useState hook is utilized for managing local state within components, allowing for dynamic updates and re-renders based on user interactions.
3. Component-Based Structure: The frontend is structured into reusable components, each responsible for specific functionality such as uploading PDF documents, asking questions, and displaying answers.
4. Styling: CSS is used for styling the components, providing a visually appealing and responsive user interface.
